        "1. Each sheet must have a clear purpose and descriptive name (max 31 chars).\n"
        "2. For columns sourced from spreadsheet data, write a SQL SELECT query in `source_query`.\n"
        "   - Use standard SQLite syntax. Only SELECT queries are allowed.\n"
        "   - **CRITICAL**: Copy table names and column names EXACTLY from the schema — "
        "including any `_suffix` at the end. Do NOT shorten or modify them.\n"
        '   - **ALWAYS double-quote table names** in SQL (e.g., `SELECT * FROM "my_table_abc123"`).\n'
        "   - Mark each column's `source` as `sql` when it comes from the query result.\n"
        "3. For computed columns, use `formula:<excel_formula>` with row-relative references "
        "(e.g., `formula:=C2*D2` will be applied to each row).\n"
        "4. **NLP COLUMNS (CRITICAL)**: When the user asks to classify, categorize, tag, "
        "extract intent, analyze sentiment, summarize, label, group by meaning, or add ANY "
        "column that does NOT already exist in the data schema - you MUST use `nlp:<instruction>`.\n"
        "   - `nlp:` columns are processed by a language model that reads each row and produces a value.\n"
        "   - The SQL `source_query` should fetch ONLY the raw data columns that exist in the table. "
        "NLP columns are added AFTER SQL extraction - do NOT include them in the SQL SELECT.\n"
        "   - **IMPORTANT**: The `nlp:` instruction MUST include the user's specific requirements "
        "verbatim - granularity expectations, examples, format, and constraints. "
        "Do NOT simplify or generalize the user's instructions.\n"
        "   - Examples:\n"
        "     - User asks 'categorize issues' -> `nlp:classify into relevant categories`\n"
        "     - User asks 'extract sentiment' -> `nlp:classify sentiment as positive/negative/neutral`\n"
        "     - User asks 'add granular subcategory, e.g. battery replacement request not just battery' "
        '-> `nlp:assign a specific, granular subcategory - e.g. "battery replacement request" not just "battery"`\n'
        "   - NEVER use `sql` as source for columns that require interpretation or don't exist in the schema.\n"
        "5. For constant values, use `static:<value>`.\n"
        "6. Use `group_by` and `aggregations` for pivot-table-style summaries "
        "(e.g., group_by=['region'], aggregations={'revenue': 'sum', 'orders': 'count'}).\n"
        "7. If the user asks for charts, specify them with proper column references.\n"
        "8. Keep the file name short, lowercase, with underscores (no spaces).\n"
        "9. When the user asks to 'export all data' or 'download the spreadsheet', "
        "create a single sheet with `SELECT * FROM <table>` as the source query.\n"
        "10. For document-extracted tables (PDFs/PPTX), use `source` as `extract:<doc_id>` on columns.\n"
