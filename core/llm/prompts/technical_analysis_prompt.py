    """
    Build a chat prompt to extract technical analysis from a source document,
    with output structured to match TechnicalAnalysisLLMOutput.

    Unlike the technical roadmap (which generates a forward-looking plan),
    this prompt focuses on extracting what IS in the document — technical
    decisions, architecture, stack, aspirations — and then provides
    analytical commentary.

    Args:
        document: The source context (raw text or extracted summary) to analyze.

    Returns:
        A list of chat messages (role/parts) ready for the LLM client.
