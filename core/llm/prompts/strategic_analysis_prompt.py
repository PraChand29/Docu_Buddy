def strategic_analysis_prompt(document: str | list[dict]):
    """
    Build a chat prompt to extract strategic analysis from a source document,
    with output structured to match StrategicAnalysisLLMOutput.

    Unlike the strategic roadmap (which generates a forward-looking plan),
    this prompt focuses on extracting what IS in the document — the creator's
    strategic intent, positioning, themes, and aspirations — and then provides
    analytical commentary.

    Args:
        document: The source context (raw text or extracted summary) to analyze.

    Returns:
        A list of chat messages (role/parts) ready for the LLM client.
